**Deployment File:** `supabase/migrations/20251206100000_analytics_foundational_metrics.sql`

---

### ✅ Phase 3: Recommendation Engine (COMPLETE)

**4 Functions Deployed:**

1. **`get_user_ingredient_profile(user_id)`**
   - Analyzes user's ingredient usage patterns (90-day history)
   - Returns ingredient frequency, last used date, recency
   - Used by recommendation engine for ingredient matching

2. **`get_user_recipe_preferences(user_id)`**
   - Learns from accepted/rejected recipes (30-day history)
   - Returns acceptance rate, preferred chaos rating, preferred persona
   - Used for behavioral scoring

3. **`check_dietary_compliance(recipe_ingredients[], dietary_restrictions[])`**
   - Filters recipes based on dietary restrictions
   - Supports: vegetarian, vegan, gluten_free, dairy_free, nut_free
   - Returns TRUE if recipe is compliant

4. **`get_recipe_recommendations(user_id, candidate_recipes, limit)`**
   - **Main recommendation engine**
   - Scores recipes on 4 dimensions (0-100 points total):
     - Ingredient Match (0-40 pts)
     - Goal Alignment (0-25 pts)
     - Behavioral Learning (0-20 pts)
     - Diversity (0-15 pts)
   - Returns ranked recommendations with confidence levels
   - Includes match explanations

**Deployment File:** `database/recommendation_engine.sql`

**Documentation:**
- `database/recommendation_engine_design.md` - Architecture & scoring system
- `database/recommendation_engine_guide.md` - Integration guide for MCP tools

---

## ❌ Phase 2: Monitoring & Dashboard (SKIPPED)

**Status:** Not deployed due to schema mismatches

**Reason:** The original Phase 2 SQL code (monitoring functions, dashboard views, user segmentation) was written assuming different column names than what exists in the actual Phase 1 schema. Multiple attempts to fix resulted in cascading errors.

**Decision:** Skip Phase 2 entirely and move to Phase 3 (recommendation engine), which is the most valuable feature.

**What Was Skipped:**
- ❌ Monitoring functions (health checks, data quality alerts)
- ❌ Dashboard views (15+ analytics views)
- ❌ User segmentation (engagement, dietary, feature usage, value segments)

**Future Work:** Phase 2 can be rewritten from scratch later when there's real data to test against.
