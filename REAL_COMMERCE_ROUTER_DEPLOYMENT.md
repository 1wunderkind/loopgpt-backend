## 🎯 Phase 3 Scoring Algorithm

The commerce router uses a **5-component weighted scoring system**:

### Scoring Components

1. **Price Score** (30% weight)
   - Lower total = higher score
   - Includes subtotal + delivery + tax

2. **Speed Score** (15% weight)
   - Faster delivery = higher score
   - Based on estimated delivery time

3. **Availability Score** (25% weight)
   - More items in stock = higher score
   - Penalizes substitutions

4. **Margin Score** (20% weight)
   - Higher commission = higher score
   - Business revenue optimization

5. **Reliability Score** (10% weight)
   - Historical success rate
   - Learned from `loopgpt_record_outcome`

### Example Scoring

**Instacart:**
- Price Score: 100 (best price)
- Speed Score: 0 (slower delivery)
- Availability Score: 100 (all items in stock)
- Margin Score: 100 (7% commission)
- Reliability Score: 50 (average history)
- **Weighted Total: 80**

**MealMe:**
- Price Score: 60 (higher price)
- Speed Score: 100 (fastest delivery)
- Availability Score: 80 (1 substitution)
- Margin Score: 50 (5% commission)
- Reliability Score: 40 (lower history)
- **Weighted Total: 45**

**Winner:** Instacart (80 > 45)

## 💰 Business Impact

### Monetization

**Affiliate Revenue:**
- Instacart: 7% commission
- Walmart: 4% commission
- MealMe: 5% commission
- Amazon Fresh: 3% commission

**Example Transaction:**
- Order Total: $43.22
- Provider: Instacart (7% commission)
- Revenue: $3.03 per order

**Projected Revenue:**
- 100 orders/day × $3.03 = $303/day
- $303/day × 30 days = $9,090/month
- **$109,080/year**

### User Engagement

**Before Commerce Layer:**
- User asks for recipes
- User leaves to shop manually
- No revenue

**After Commerce Layer:**
- User asks for recipes
- User gets grocery list with pantry detection
- User clicks "Prepare cart to order"
- User confirms order
- **Revenue generated**

**Estimated Conversion:**
- 10% of grocery list requests → cart preparation
- 50% of cart preparations → confirmed orders
- **Overall: 5% conversion from recipe to order**
