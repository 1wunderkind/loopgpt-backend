### Full Description

**Stop fighting your diet. Start looping.**

LoopGPT is the AI nutrition coach that actually adapts to you. Set your goals once, weigh in weekly, and watch your meal plan automatically adjust based on your real progress. No more guessing, no more plateaus, no more giving up.

**What makes LoopGPT different?**

🔄 **The Loop** - Your plan adapts automatically based on weekly weigh-ins. Behind schedule? We'll adjust. Ahead of pace? We'll optimize. It's nutrition coaching that learns from your results.

🍽️ **Smart Meal Planning** - Get personalized meal plans tailored to your goals, dietary preferences, and lifestyle. Whether you're losing weight, building muscle, or maintaining, we've got you covered.

👨‍🍳 **Chef Personas** - Meet Jamie Leftover, Paul Leftovuse, and Gordon Leftover-Slay - three AI chefs who turn your leftovers into amazing recipes. Pick your chaos level (1-10) and get anything from comfort food to culinary experiments.

🍕 **Goal-Aligned Ordering** - Want to eat out? We'll find restaurants near you with meals that actually fit your plan. Every dish is scored 0-100 on how well it matches your nutrition goals.

📊 **Progress Visualization** - See your weight trends, celebrate milestones, and share your wins with beautiful progress cards.
