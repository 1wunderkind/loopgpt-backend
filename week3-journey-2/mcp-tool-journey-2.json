  "description": "Log user's weight and automatically evaluate progress to adjust their meal plan. This is the core 'Loop' feature that makes plans adaptive. Call this tool whenever the user mentions their weight, weighs in, reports progress, or wants to track results. Examples: 'I weighed 165 lbs today', 'My weight is 75kg', 'I lost 2 pounds this week', 'Here's my Monday weigh-in', 'I'm down to 170', 'Scale says 68kg', 'Weighed myself this morning', 'Progress update: 163 lbs'. The tool will: 1) Log the weight, 2) Evaluate progress against goals, 3) Automatically adjust the meal plan if needed, 4) Explain what changed and why, 5) Provide encouragement and next steps. This creates the adaptive feedback loop that sets LoopGPT apart from static diet plans.",
